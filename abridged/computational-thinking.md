This sums up everything.

If a student practices these all things.. he will be a good developer.

What is Computational Thinking?
Computational Thinking is the process of formulating a problem, finding a solution to the problem and expressing it in such a way that humans or machines can understand the solution. It involves the use of problem solving methods to decompose the problem into smaller manageable subproblems, identifying the right abstractions so as to deal with scale and complexity, finding existing patterns or models that can be adapted, building an algorithm to solve the problem and in case of multiple solutions, analysing the solutions on multiple parameters to identify the one that best meets the given situation.

If I can teach all these things for students, that would be enough achivement.

There is lot of effort needed by the students.
