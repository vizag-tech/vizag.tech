### Process driven approach to education

A process-driven approach is one that develops a system that supports teachers and raises the number of students who benefit from those teachers’ efforts.

So, what does a process-driven approach to education look like? First off, as noted above, it’s flexible and values experimentation. If you’re not willing to experiment with a new way of doing things, then your product will stagnate. However, experimentation is only useful if it results in feedback, which is a necessary part of making improvements. We are lucky to have a passionate user base that is highly invested in the quality of our program. As a result we get a ton of feedback from our students. We then match it with our own observations and are thus able to make constant updates to our curriculum. This is why our curriculum today is not only different from our curriculum two years ago, but better.


Another way of describing the feedback-improvement loop is continuous deployment. In order to get the most out of this practice, it’s important that both feedback and improvement be immediate. Compare this to a static product like a book. Certainly book authors and publishers receive feedback on the content they produce, and use that feedback to iterate in the form of updated editions; however, their pace of iteration is far too slow to generate useful compounding effects. With continuous deployment we receive feedback, make a change, then receive feedback on the change we made, and so on. In this fashion we can ensure that the benefits of the feedback-improvement loop compound over time.


All of this gets at the most important element of our philosophy as education engineers: stay oriented towards results. And by “results” I don’t mean the number of students enrolled in our program or the number of lessons that we produce — I mean educational outcomes. If our students aren’t seeing better education outcomes based on the improvements that we are making, then they aren’t improvements at all. This philosophy goes into everything we do. Furthermore, it stands in direct contrast to the approach found in many books, which is not only static, as we have discussed, but which also tends to focus on content rather than outcomes. Most books and courses are built to expose people to a list of topics, and not built to drive people to some educational outcome.


// What are my program's educational outcomes?

// Before I design a curriculum....
agree on a set of non-negotiable end goals.

[YES] We wanted our students to finish the program with a deep understanding of programming fundamentals.
[YES] We wanted our students to learn how to learn effectively. 
[YES] And, we wanted our students to be well-positioned to acquire high-quality jobs and launch careers in software development. 

I say these items are non-negotiable because they aren’t processes — they’re the end results that everything else builds towards.



// Current problem in the market...
Compare this to the vast majority of existing educational content and curricula, which are designed to cover as many topics as possible without much focus on how well students actually understand the material.

Ultimately, the goal of setting students up to land high paying jobs and launch careers is inextricably tied to the goal of helping them acquire a deep understanding of fundamentals. For this reason, and in consideration of our MBL-based pedagogy, mastery of fundamentals is our principle aim.

// mastery of fundamentals is our principle aim.

the next step is to enforce it. We do this through rigorous assessments where we evaluate each student’s proficiency in each fundamental topic before allowing them to move on to the next one.

// enforce it.

And because of our career-oriented goals, our assessments are modeled after real-life interview situations. This means that we have to develop one-on-one live coding, essay, and take-home project assessments that both mimic real-world job interviews and demand mastery.

// one-on-one live coding, essay, take-home


With the assessments in place, we’re able to focus on driving students past them. In order to do this, we look at the content in each assessment and then build a curriculum that targets that content.

// First create the assessments, then build the content...

High-quality assessments are an important part of MBL, but as a results-oriented program we have to do more than just assess students — we have to assess the right things.

// High-quality assessments, assess the right things.

Our goal is to help students launch careers, and to do this, we have to consider factors beyond technical skill because that’s what real-world companies require. For example, we know from our experience in the software world (including mine as a hiring manager), and from job listings at top companies, that communication skills are just as important as technical skills — sometimes more so.

// consider factors beyond technical skills

In order to help students practice communication skills and identify associated problems early on we introduced a “Non-Technical Grade” to each assessment. Further, we require that every assessment includes 1-on-1 interaction in either live-coding or written form (just as in a real job), during which we evaluate students’ ability to communicate on a technical level clearly. 

// "Non-Technical Grade", 1-on-1 interaction.

helping students master fundamental skills

// this is my tag line.

// Actual summary of the whole process..

The above is a simplified version of how we went from envisioning our desired end result (helping students master fundamental skills), to determining how we would move towards that end result (assessments), to building an actual path to reach the end result (curriculum). 

All content at Launch School was developed in this fashion, and the only things that are truly static are the results we are pushing towards. Everything down the chain is open for revision if warranted. The fact that we have assessments is very unlikely to change, but the assessments themselves can and do change. We observe how students are moving through the process, see what is challenging them, and design our assessments to fill in gaps. And if there is something in the assessments that students are consistently having trouble with, then we look at the curriculum to see why students are having trouble. And this leads to the lowest and most dynamic level of our content — the lessons, which we are constantly updating so that everything further up the chain works more effectively.

// Static - results we are pushing towards
// Assessments - themselves do change.
// Observer how students are moving through the process, see what is challenging and design our assessments to fill in gaps.
// When assessments are difficult for students to do, then update the content - the lessons. Most dynamic level of the content.

What do you do?
We are helping students master fundamental skills.

---

it depends on an entire team that is working together in a shared rhythm of carefully-crafted processes.  


Consistency matters, and the same is true in education. If you want your students to achieve great educational outcomes, then you have to do it through consistent application of effective processes.

Launch School has been around for a few years now, but by no means have we settled into “the answer” for how to teach coding. We firmly believe in what we’ve built, but we know that it’s going to change. Launch School is the result of years of experimentation and we’re still learning. We are making incremental quality improvements every day, and that means that our already high-quality content is only going to get better.  

What is not going to change, however, are the results that we’re driving towards, and we do that through our commitment to a flexible, sustainable, iterative process of continual improvement, which is guided by our career-oriented goals.

A Place with Heart
Although it is an online learning environment, LS is placed filled with care and friendliness. I remember the first day I join the course, Chris, the instructor and co-founder personally greeted me to welcome me to the course. A special thanks to him also for writing me a letter of recommendation to the University of Pennsylvania.
TA are very friendly and helpful to me throughout my journey. They genuinely wanted to help you with your learning. Never had I had to wait for longer than a day to get a reply in the forum from them. Specifically, I want to thank Victor Paolo Reyes, Brandon Conway, Pete Hanson and Naveed Fida for all the help you extended me throughout the course.

There are two main things that strike me about the journey to become an itamae
- The dedication to mastery of the craft at each stage of the journey.
- Just how high the bar for achievement is set.

. If you do want to scale the heights though, you have to follow that journey; there are no short-cuts.


// Useful for my writings...

Just like making sushi, learning to code is essentially a simple idea. Anyone can do it. Just follow a tutorial, and within a few hours you can have a website up and running, or can create a simple application. There is however a massive gulf between following a set of instructions to code a basic calculator app and the itamae level of knowledge and skill required to be a professional software engineer.

Remember this why bootcamps work....

One dirty secret of our industry is that most programming jobs are bad — low paying, menial, and mundane. Added to that, the danger in learning just enough, is that it’s very quickly becoming not enough.

---

We have a very different goal: to enable our students to target the best jobs and prepare for a long-lasting career. We use this goal as an end-point and engineer our curriculum to meet it.

---

So how do we do that? We spend time to really understand what top tech employers want from new hires:
To be productive in a very short space of time.
To be able to ramp up quickly on the company’s tech stack and codebase
To solve problems at scale and at a high level of complexity
To work well as part of a team

Bad programming jobs are not only unpleasant, but they don’t provide the kind of experience necessary to transition into good jobs later on. Changes in the marketplace have made such transitions significantly harder. This is an often overlooked truth, which is why I think it’s so vital that we take time to explore the difference between a job, which you get with “just enough” knowledge, and a career, which you get by starting out with a mastery of fundamentals.

that goes into planning, implementing, maintaining, and continually iterating and improving that structure
