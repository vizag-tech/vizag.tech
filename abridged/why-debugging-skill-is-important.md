### Why debugging skill is important?

There are few orthogonal skills without which you will not go far.  
  
These skills deal with mindsets and knowledge of tools to make you a productive programmer. Debugging is probably the MOST IMPORTANT SKILL for a capable programmer.  
  
While it is never discussed as a first class concept in most classes, for a new developer proficiency in debugging can make all the difference in how fast you grow in your job.  This is because:  
- As a new programmer you will make a lot of mistakes
- If you cannot debug fast, you will get blocked and block your team because your work is not ready
- If you repeatedly ask for help for many issues, you will lose reputation as a developer
- The more time you spend debugging, the less time you have to learn other things on the job like design, tools, product space, customer behavior etc. which are important for your growth.
- So a vicious cycle develops and it is frustrating to come out of it.  
  
In contrast, good troubleshooters/debuggers who can debug all kinds of problems like installation errors, ide errors, customer problems, their own code, other programmers code etc. are highly respected and shine through in the early stages of their career.  
  
In many companies, it is not uncommon to start new developers on "outstanding bugs/customer issues" as a way to bring them up to speed on the teams application/product. If you are weak in this area, you are off to a bad start!    
  
Once you learn how to use the debugger and start developing a debugging mindset, you are just a breakpoint away from solving most of your infinite loops and other problems :-)
