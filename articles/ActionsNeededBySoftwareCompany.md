### Actions needed by Software Company in Vizag.

Reality#1:   
B.Tech passed out people and looking for jobs to move to Hyd or Banglore. Training also is taken there. Institutes like Coding Sastra has moved to Hyd from Vizag. They are doing good, with students from Vizag taking training from them in Hyd.   
   
> Action:  
> Conduct off campus drives and hire them in the Final year. Identify your key skillset needs and mentor them specific to that.  
  

Reality#2:  
People don't know that you have vacant positions.  
  
> Action:   
> Publish the open positions on your website. Keep your career page up to date and attractive.
   
Reality#3:  
Capable students want to stay in Vizag. Finding a job for these people is just-one-week-task.   
   
> Actions:   
> Internship early in 3rd-year summer, pay decent, challenging work. For product companies and exceptional quality services companies. To succeed you need such people.   
    
I am actively engaged with Reality#3 group of people. Because I believe that **capable peoples' stay in Vizag will move the needle** of the software industry state forward in Vizag.
