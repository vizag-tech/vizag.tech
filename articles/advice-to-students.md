### Advice to students

Follow this process to become at creating software.  

Find a project that motivates you.  
Writing bad code is better than not writing any code. Learn from your mistakes.  
Read other people's code.  
Don't listen too much to other devs / books / blogs. Do things your own way. Again, learn from your mistakes.  
Don't be afraid to reinvent the wheel. You'll learn a lot doing so.  
Always publish your code to Github. It doesn't matter if you think it's bad. It gives you a notion of finishing things.
