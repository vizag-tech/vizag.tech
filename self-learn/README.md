### Self-Learners

The goal is to encourage and support self-learners. People who have selected some projects related to computing to solve. We support them by suggesting how to unblock and proceed further to solve their problem.

Meet regularly to discuss about what they have found and make other people aware of the tools and technologies that can be used to solve these problems.

It's a community of self-learners.
